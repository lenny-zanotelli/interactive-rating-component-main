## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- DOM
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I struggled with the inputs, button and label to find out what was the best use for each.
I also had difficulties with the Event listener and their logic but with my current training, I think it clicked. I must continue the practice of JS for the future.

### Useful resources
